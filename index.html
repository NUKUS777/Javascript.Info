        <h1>Function Declaration</h1>
        <h2>Global variables</h2>
        <p>Variables declared outside of any function, such as the outer userName in the code above, are called global.
    
            Global variables are visible from any function (unless shadowed by locals).
            
        It’s a good practice to minimize the use of global variables. Modern code has few or no globals. Most variables reside in their functions. Sometimes though, they can be useful to store project-level data.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Values passed to a function as parameters are copied to its local variables.</li>
            <li>A function may access outer variables. But it works only from inside out. The code outside of the function doesn’t see its local variables.</li>
            <li>A function can return a value. If it doesn’t, then its result is undefined.</li>
        </ul>

       <h1>Function expression</h1>

       <h2>Callback functions</h2>
       <p>In practice, such functions are quite useful. The major difference between a real-life ask and the example above is that real-life functions use more complex ways to interact with the user than a simple confirm. In the browser, such functions usually draw a nice-looking question window. But that’s another story.

        The arguments showOk and showCancel of ask are called callback functions or just callbacks.
        
        The idea is that we pass a function and expect it to be “called back” later if necessary. In our case, showOk becomes the callback for “yes” answer, and showCancel for “no” answer.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function Declaration: a function, declared as a separate statement, in the main code flow:            </li>
            <li>Function Expression: a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here, the function is created on the right side of the “assignment expression” =:</li>
            <li>A Function Expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.

            </li>
            <li>A Function Declaration can be called earlier than it is defined.            </li>
            <li>Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.
            </li>
            <li>If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”.
            </li>
            <li>If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”.
            </li>
            <li>Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.
            </li>
            <li>Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.
            </li>
